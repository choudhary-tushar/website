Welcome to my personal website! I'm Tushar Choudhary, a Master of Data Science - Computational Linguistics student at the University of British Columnbia. I'm passionate about Data Science, Natural Language Processing and Web Development.

On this website, I will be adding a collection of my work, projects, and blog posts related to my interests. I enjoy playing chess and exploring new technologies, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
